## General Information

There exists only one repository for all skins. Clone it into yourILIAS/Customizing/global/skin folder. Donâ€™t forget to change branches for the correct skin to be active. The less file contains all variables to change the default skin. If the skin is not displayed correctly try to compile the less file into the css file:

	lessc unibe-skin.less unibe-skin.css

Be aware when merging the branches with each other, that the names of the css and less file are different.
